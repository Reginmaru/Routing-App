v0.0

1. Creating directories for routeXML, link and node. Thinking of the next steps... Construct link and node classes first. 
2. They need to be instantiated so can't use abstract classes.
3. Haven't yet learned how to attach one - many on java so gonna look that up after I create classes.

v0.01

1. created both the link and node classes. At first I tried using node.Name() as a return value but I didn't want to mess with the code at this point. I kept them as String and I will add exceptions to routeXML if they don't exist.
